# scoobydoogame

## Whats up guys

I'm using PlayCanvas for this project. This is the most goated library for 3d Games

## Before you begin, go to playcanvas.com and make an account!!!

Now, I want you to go to my repository, and go to the repo called
### scoobydoogame

Fork, then clone the repo.


# IT IS HIHGLY IMPORTANT YOU FOLLOW THESE NEXT STEPS CAREFULLY


Youll notice that in the repo, there is a .zip file.

This .zip file (called First Person Shooter.zip) is the entire game.

Go to PlayCanvas, go to your profile, and there should be a tab called, "Projects" with a home icon next to it

On the left-hand side, there should be a button that says "Import Project"

Click on this, then select your zip file.
